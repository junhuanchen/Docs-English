#九轴传感器

The Webduino Bit has a built-in nine-axis sensor, model MPU-9250. In addition to detecting the acceleration and rotation in the space, it can also detect the attitude angle and compass through the auxiliary detection of the magnetometer. application.

> Note that the 9-axis sensor needs to * update the Webduino Bit to the latest version*. For the update method, please refer to: [Webduino Bit Initialization Settings] (setting.html#_top) "OTA Remote Update"

## Accelerometer

The accelerometer mainly detects the "*instant*" acceleration change when the x, y, and z three-axis linear movement. To use the accelerometer, you must first understand the direction of the accelerometer in the Webduino Bit. As shown in the following figure, the development board will be 5x5 full color. The dot matrix is ​​facing up, the gold finger is facing towards itself, * the vertical up and down direction is the z axis * (upward is negative, down is positive), * horizontal is left and right x axis * (to the left is negative, to the right is positive * The level is y-axis* (below in your own direction, positive in your direction).

Open [Webduino Blockly Bit Experience Edition] (https://webduino.com.cn/link.html?lang=zh-hans&type=blockly), put * development board blocks in the editing area, select *Wi-Fi online *, and enter the Device ID, and then put the building block of "*set mup9250 is the nine-axis sensor*" in the development board, and then insert the block of "*mpu9250 start detecting accelerometer*" below it.

Use the blocks that display the text, and display the acceleration in the x, y, and z directions. Click the red button on the upper right to execute. You will see the acceleration in the three directions appear on the web page. Because of the location and the initial calibration of the sensor, each block Bits have slight errors when acceleration detection is enabled, but Z is usually more than a thousand negative (** is m**, 1g is usually a gravity parameter), X and Y are usually at 200~ Between -200, you can pick up the Webduino Bit and scroll up and down, and you will see the value change. Since the detected value is "*Acceleration*", *When the development board does not move or move at a constant speed, The acceleration will remain within a stable value range*.

> Remind you that since the detected value is "acceleration", * may generate a reverse acceleration at the moment of starting or stopping * (just as the bus suddenly stops or starts, the passenger will lean forward or backward) Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate some logical judgments during development, or to avoid too many start and stop actions.

## Gyro

The accelerometer mainly detects the instantaneous acceleration change of the linear movement, while the gyroscope detects the angle change of "*instant*" when rotating. As shown in the following figure, the development board 5x5 full color dot matrix is ​​facing upward, the golden finger is pinned. Towards yourself, * rotates around the z axis to yaw* (clockwise rotation is positive, counterclockwise rotation is negative), * rotates around the x axis to roll* (clockwise toward itself rotates negative, counterclockwise rotation becomes positive) * Rotate to pitch* around the y axis (clockwise to positive and counterclockwise to negative).

The combination of building blocks is the same as that of the accelerometer. Just select the “gyro” from the Start Detection drop-down menu and click the red button on the upper right to execute. You will see the angle change in the three directions is displayed in the webpage because it is an instantaneous angle change. , so when * stops rotating, you will see the angle gradually return to the value when starting *.

## attitude angle (currently only roll and pitch are supported)

Different from the gyroscope, the “instantaneous” angle change is presented. The attitude angle represents the angle of the actual rotation. As shown in the following figure, the 5x5 full-color dot matrix of the development board is facing upwards, and the golden finger is facing toward itself. The z-axis rotation is yaw* (the counterclockwise rotation angle is incremented, the interval is -180~180 degrees), * is rotated around the x-axis to roll* (clockwise rotation angle is incremented, the interval is -180~180 degrees). The y-axis is rotated to pitch* (the counterclockwise rotation is incremented by an angle of -180 to 180 degrees).

The combination of the building blocks is the same as that of the accelerometer. Just select the “Attitude Angle” from the Start Detection drop-down menu and click the red button on the upper right to execute. You will see the change in the angle of the three directions in the web page.

## Magnetometer

The magnetometer can mainly calculate the value of the development board in the earth's magnetic field space, but it mainly depends on the latitude and longitude of the location. At present, it is impossible to provide an accurate numerical interval reference. Therefore, it is recommended to use an accelerometer, a gyroscope or a posture angle. To achieve the application, the building block combination is the same as the accelerometer. Just select the “Magnetometer” from the Start Detection drop-down menu and click the red button at the top right to execute. You will see three values ​​appear on the web page.
