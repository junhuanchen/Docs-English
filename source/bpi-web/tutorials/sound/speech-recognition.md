# Speech recognition

With the ever-changing technology of technology, the voice recognition function that can be used in mobile devices in the past can now be fully realized. Combined with the technology of Google voice recognition, if the computer has a microphone, it can easily make "Hey Siri" or "OK. Google's fun voice control.

## Speech recognition building block description

The speech recognition building blocks can recognize Chinese and English languages ​​separately, and cannot mix and match Chinese and English.

The voice recognition building block belongs to the type of “* will continue to execute the rear program* after execution is completed” (click on the small question mark in the front) and the voice recognition time is two seconds. After the recognition, the program will be executed*.

## Displaying voice recognition text through small monsters

After the speech recognition, you can use the "identified text" building block. The example in the following figure will let the little monster speak the recognized text after the speech recognition.

When using the voice recognition building block, if it is a "web version" editor, after the web page is executed, it will ask "whether the microphone is allowed" and check the permission.

After the web page allows the microphone, a small dot will appear on the browser tab to indicate that the microphone is working.

At this point, you can speak into the microphone, and you can see the little monsters telling the recognized words.

## Continuous speech recognition

By recognizing the characteristics of the building blocks and matching the repeated loops, the speech recognition can be continuously performed to update the text spoken by the little monsters.

## Voice Identification Control Development Board

If the speech recognition is combined with the development board and the logic is used to judge the words contained in the text, the application of the voice control of the Internet of Things can be realized. The example of the following figure can be easily changed by the voice-activated switch light or by the voice control.
