Third party library
=================================================

.. Hint::

     Third-party Arduino code may have missing interfaces, but generally there are alternate interfaces that can be used instead. There is no need to be nervous when there is an error, and it can be processed and repaired according to the interface type.

Here you will experience the extra rich library code of Arduino. More third-party functional modules are available in the major open source communities, but all of them are validated here.
