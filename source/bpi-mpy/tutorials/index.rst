Basic tutorial
=================================================

MicroPython is a streamlined implementation of the Python 3 language, including a small portion of the Python standard library, optimized to run in microcontrollers and restricted environments.

.. Hint::

    Â If you have never learned Python3, I suggest you learn the basics of Python3 software from the `Python 3 Noob tutorial <https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-tutorial.html>`_ here. The hardware part will be better.
