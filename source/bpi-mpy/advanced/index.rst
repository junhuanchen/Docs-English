Advanced tutorial
==============================================================

When you have mastered the basic tutorials above, you are already getting started, and you have the basic ability to use code. If you want to be advanced, you should look at the more advanced development documentation.

Seeing this is going into the real sense of Python programming.

Please learn to install the Python3 environment and run the Python3 code from the `Python3 Novice Tutorial <https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-tutorial.html>`_ here.

The next tutorial may be a lot difficult for you, but it is also the only way for you to practice programming.

Press Win + R on any place in Windows to pop up the run box and type `cmd` to confirm that a black window pops up.

Then make sure you have the Python3 and PIP code package management tools installed on your system.

As shown in the figure.

- Enter python to display `Python 3.5.4 (v3.5.4:3f56838, Aug 8 2017, 02:17:05) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32` means that python 3.5.4 is installed. Press Ctrl + C to exit.

- Enter pip -V to get a current version of the pip Python package management tool, which will help you quickly install some toolkits.

Once you have confirmed these two things, you can start your advanced journey.
