Talk about VSCode
------------------------------------------------------

At the Build 2015 conference, in addition to Microsoft's release of the Microsoft Edge browser and the new Windows 10 system, the biggest surprise was the announcement of the free cross-platform Visual Studio Code editor!

Visual Studio Code (VS Code / VSC) is a free, open source, modern lightweight code editor that supports syntax highlighting, smart code completion, custom shortcuts, parenthesis matching, and color in almost all major development languages. Features such as differentiation, code snippets, code comparison Diff, GIT commands, support plug-in extensions, and optimization for web development and cloud application development. Software cross-platform support Win, Mac and Linux, running smoothly, can be described as Microsoft's conscience...
